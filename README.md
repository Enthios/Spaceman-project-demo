# Spaceman-project-demo

Stephen Howard


**Description:**

SpaceMan is a modern iteration of the classic game HangMan; it is sleek, mysterious, and the best new addition? The hangman has space armor, now. 

A word is randomly selected, and you must guess if a letter exists within the mystery word. If it does, it'll show on the screen; guess all of the letters correctly and you win! 

Guess incorrectly 4 times, and the whole mission fails. 

The fate of the universe depends on your guessing powers...
